- [DEMO LINK](https://lena-kravchenko.github.io/Squares_Test_assignment/)

## Technologies:
HTML, CSS, Javascript (ES6)

## Requirements:
1.	The basic state is a square of 4x4 cells with add row (bottom) and add column (right side) buttons. Cell size is 50px.

2.	When any cell has hovered - there should appear 2 extra buttons: delete row (left side) and delete column (on top) buttons:
 
Delete buttons should appear on the same line/column of the hovered cell.
Delete buttons should move smoothly in accordance with mouse position (hovered cell).
If you move the mouse out of square - delete buttons should disappear.

3.	When you press the delete row button - you should delete specifically the row where the button is placed. The same with the delete column button - you should delete specifically the column where the button is placed.

4.	If the table has just one row - a delete row button shouldn’t appear.

5.	If the table has just one column - a delete column button shouldn’t appear.

6.	When you press an add column button - a column should be added onto the right side.

7.	When you press an add row button - a row should be added into the bottom.

8.	Your markup should strictly follow the design (pictures above).

9.	When you hover over any of the delete or add buttons, the button should become a little lighter. The color transition should be smooth.
